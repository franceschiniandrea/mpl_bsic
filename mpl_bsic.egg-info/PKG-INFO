# MPL BSIC Package

## Installation

To install, run

```
pip install mpl_bsic
```

Then you can import the functions from the module, for example

The package supports all python versions starting from 3.9

```
from mpl_bsic import apply_bsic_style
```

## Docs and TLDR

Read the docs on [this link](https://mpl-bsic.readthedocs.io/).
All the functions are explained extensively and you can find example code/plots.

**WARNING**: Be sure to read the docs for apply_bsic_style, and in particular how it handles the title of the plot.
If you don't follow that rule, the title of the plot will be rendered using Garamond and not Gill Sans MT (which is the correct font which should be used). And also read carefully the part about the figsize to use, especially when exporting to use in a Word file.

A brief overview of the functions of the module:

* `apply_bsic_style`: applies the BSIC styles to a plot (font families, font sizes).
* `apply_bsic_logo`: applies the BSIC logo to the plot. You can specify the size, location and logo type.
* `check_figsize`: checks the figsize of your plot, to make sure it will be rendered correctly in MS Word.
    To learn more about this, look at the documentation
* `format_timeseries_axis`: formats the x axis of a timeseries plot.
    You can specify the time unit (yearly, monthly, daily), the frequency (e.g. a tick every 3M), and the format (e.g. MM/YYYY or MMM YYYY)
* `preprocess_dataframe`: preprocesses a dataframe, by setting the index to the date (and converting to datetime)
    and transforming all the columns to lowercase for easier use in the project
* `plot_trade`: this function is WIP

## If the matplotlib fonts do not work

Check the full guide on the documentation. Anyway, you need to install
Garamond and Gill Sans MT and clear your matplotlib cache.

## Coming Next / TODOs (if you have any ideas be sure to tell me)

1) plot trade (as bloomberg with last price and stuff)
