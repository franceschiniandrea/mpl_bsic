    r"""Apply the BSIC Style to an existing matplotlib plot.

    You can call this function at any point in your code, the BSIC style will be applied
    regardless. This function works by adding an animation such that,
    regardless of where you specify your title,
    it will be updated with the correct style.

    First, it will set the correct font sizes
    and font family for the plot text (labels, ticks...).
    It will also set the color cycle used in matplotlib to the colors
    specified in the BSIC design standards.
    If you already plotted, it will, again,
    change the colors of the lines to the correct ones.
    The function will make sure that, whenever you update the title of the plot,
    it gets drawn with the correct style.

    Additionally, it will display the sources specified in the parameter
    at the bottom of the figure.
    It will always add *BSIC* as a source.

    .. warning:: When exporting the figure for publication, make sure to use
        :func:`export_figure() <mpl_bsic.export_figure>`. This makes sure
        that the animation is performed and the correct style is applied to the title

    Parameters
    ----------
    fig : matplotlib.figure.Figure
        Matplotlib Figure instance.
    ax : matplotlib.axes.Axes
        Matplotlib Axes instance.

        .. deprecated:: 1.3.2
            The ``ax`` parameter will be removed in a future release, since it is not needed anymore.
            ``apply_bsic_style`` now gets all the axes from the figure instance (and is capable
            of styling all the axes at once), thus it is
            not necessary to include the axes in the function call anymore.

    sources : str | list[str], optional
        List of sources, by default "BSIC".
        You can either specify a string (if you have only one source)
        or a list of strings (multiple sources).
        Since BSIC is always a source, it will always be included.

        **NB**: if when calling ``plt.show()`` the text seems cutted out, don't worry.
        When exporting using ``bbox_inches="tight"``,
        it will seamlessly fit within the figure.
        This happens because I want to make sure
        there is enough space between the plot and the sources text,
        so I position the text at the very bottom of the figure.
    fill_between : bool, optional
        If true, it colors the area between each line and the 0 axis in the plot.
        The fill is consistent with the color of each line, and you can specify
        the alpha to use in the next parameter. Defaults to ``False``.

        .. versionadded:: 1.3.2
    fill_between_alpha : float, optional
        The alpha value to use when ``fill_between`` is set to ``True``.
        Defaults to 0.25.

        .. versionadded:: 1.3.2
